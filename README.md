# The Impact of Social Media on Academic Efficiency

This project investigates how social media usage affects students’ study efficiency and academic performance — specifically targeting students from Gen Z and Gen Alpha.

## Objective
To analyze the influence of different factors such as social media platform, usage duration, study hours, and concentration ability on a calculated "efficiency score."

---

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Survey distributed among students aged 7–25.
- **Data Processing:** Categorical variables were encoded using appropriate encoding techniques (label encoding for ordinal data, one-hot encoding for nominal data).
- **Model:** Linear regression model trained on preprocessed data to predict an efficiency score.
- **Target Variable:** Efficiency Score  
  > Formula: `eff = 0.4 * StudyHours + 0.3 * Grades + 0.3 * SocialHours`
